## Challenge Overview
The Winter Festival organizers needed to choose an official mascot.  
The Council of Mine MCP extension was used to convene nine AI personas:
- Pragmatist
- Visionary
- Systems Thinker
- Optimist
- Devil’s Advocate
- Mediator
- User Advocate
- Traditionalist
- Data Analyst

Each council member debated the mascot options:
- Snowman ⛄ (Classic, recognizable, easy to make costumes)
- Penguin 🐧 (Cute, marketable, kids love penguins)
- Polar bear 🐻‍❄️ (Majestic, powerful, represents strength)
- Ice fairy 🧚 (Whimsical, unique, Instagram-worthy)
- Yeti 🦣 (Mysterious, fun, tells a story)

## Debate & Decision
- All nine council members provided opinions.
- A democratic vote was conducted.
- **Result:** Tie between the Ice Fairy 🧚 and the Snowman ⛄.
- **Official Announcement:** The Snowman will be the Winter Festival mascot!
