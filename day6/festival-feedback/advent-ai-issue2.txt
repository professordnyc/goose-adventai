Title: Add photo booth near ice skating rink

Several visitors have asked if we can set up a photo booth near the ice skating rink. 
They want to take pictures with the winter decorations and their skating outfits.

This could be a great addition for next year if we can't do it now. Maybe with props 
like scarves, hats, and winter-themed signs?
