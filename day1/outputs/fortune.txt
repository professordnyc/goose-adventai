═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    🌙 Your Winter Fortune Awaits 🌙

    *Madame Zelda's eyes grow distant as she peers into 
     the swirling mists within her crystal ball...*

    When midnight's bell tolls thrice upon the snow,
    And shadows dance where frozen rivers flow,
    A secret kept in winter's ancient hold
    Shall whisper truths that time has left untold.

    🔮 Madame Zelda's Cryptic Vision:
    
       "Ahhhh, my child... *she narrows her eyes*
        The spirits show me veiled paths through frost-laden trees.
        Three crows circle at dusk - an omen of transformation.
        What you seek hides beneath layers of ice and time.
        The seventh snowflake that falls upon your hand
        carries a message from those who walked before...
        
        Beware the warmth that melts too quickly,
        For some mysteries must remain frozen until their hour."

    💝 Your Winter Romance Fortune 🌹

    *Madame Zelda's eyes soften as rose-colored mist
     swirls gently in her crystal ball...*

    By firelight's glow and candleshine warm,
    Two hearts unite through winter's storm.
    Where snowflakes fall on lovers' eyes,
    True affection blooms beneath cold skies.

    🔮 Madame Zelda's Tender Vision:
    
       "Ah, my dear... *she smiles knowingly*
        The spirits whisper of romance awakening.
        I see you wrapped in a cozy blanket,
        Sharing warmth with someone special.
        
        There will be stolen glances over steaming mugs,
        Hands touching as you walk through fresh snow,
        A kiss beneath icicles sparkling like diamonds,
        And whispered promises by the winter hearth.
        
        Someone is thinking of you even now,
        Planning something sweet for the solstice ahead.
        The universe is weaving threads of connection,
        Drawing hearts together like snowflakes to earth."

                        FORTUNE #4: SPOOKY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    👻 Your Winter Spook Fortune 🦇

    *Madame Zelda's candles flicker ominously as dark shadows
     dance across her crystal ball...*

    When winter's darkness falls at four,
    And something scratches at your door,
    When frost forms faces on the glass,
    Remember: not all shadows pass.

    🔮 Madame Zelda's Chilling Vision:
    
       "Ooooh... *she shivers despite the warm room*
        The spirits are restless tonight, child.
        I see something lurking in the snowdrifts,
        Watching... waiting... but what does it want?
        
        You'll hear strange sounds in the blizzard—
        Footsteps crunching in fresh snow, yet no one's there.
        Your breath will fog in your own bedroom,
        Though the radiator hisses with heat.
        
        On the longest night, when the moon hides its face,
        Look not into the frozen lake's surface,
        For what looks back may not be your reflection.
        
        The Winter Wraith walks when temperatures drop below zero.
        Keep your lights burning bright, dear one.
        
        *she leans closer, whispering*
        ...Do NOT answer."

                         FORTUNE #5: WISE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    🧙 Your Winter Wisdom Fortune 📜

    *Madame Zelda closes her eyes, breathing deeply as
     ancient symbols glow softly in her crystal ball...*

    The winter teaches those who pause to learn,
    That dormant seeds await spring's return.
    In stillness, strength; in silence, song—
    The quiet months make spirits strong.

    🔮 Madame Zelda's Ancient Wisdom:
    
       "Ah, my child... *she speaks with measured grace*
        Come, sit with me in this sacred space.
        The elders have walked through countless winters,
        And their wisdom echoes through the frost.
        
        Winter is nature's meditation—
        A time when the earth rests and reflects.
        You too must honor this season of introspection.
        What lies beneath your surface, waiting to emerge?
        
        The snow buries last year's dead leaves,
        Transforming decay into nourishment for tomorrow.
        So too must you let go of what no longer serves,
        Trusting that from endings come new beginnings.
        
        Remember: The bare tree is not dead, merely patient.
        The frozen pond is not lost, merely transformed.
        And you, dear one, are not stagnant in this quiet time—
        You are gathering strength for the growth ahead.
        
        Embrace winter's lesson: In the deepest darkness,
        We discover our inner light."

    "Five fortunes I have cast for you today, dear seeker.
     Each carries a different truth, a different path.
     Listen to the one that resonates with your soul—
     For the spirits speak to each of us in our own language.
     
     May these winter fortunes guide you through the cold months,
     Bringing warmth, wisdom, wonder, and perhaps a touch of magic
     To your journey through the season of snow and stars."
