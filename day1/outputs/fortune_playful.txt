    ⛄ Your Winter Playfulness Fortune 🎿

    *Madame Zelda giggles as colorful sparkles bounce
     playfully around inside her crystal ball...*

    Build a fort of snow and ice,
    Throw a snowball—once or twice!
    Catch a flake upon your tongue,
    Remember what it's like to be young!

    🔮 Madame Zelda's Whimsical Vision:
    
       "Ooh la la! *she claps excitedly like a child*
        The spirits are doing cartwheels in the snow!
        They want you to have FUN this winter, darling!
        
        I see you making snow angels at midnight,
        Having an epic snowball fight with friends,
        Sledding down the biggest hill you can find,
        And building the most ridiculous snowman ever—
        Complete with a carrot nose and silly hat!
        
        The universe says: ENOUGH with being serious!
        Go ice skating and fall down laughing.
        Make hot chocolate with WAY too many marshmallows.
        Wear the most outrageous winter sweater you own.
        Have an indoor pillow fort party during a blizzard!
        
        *she twirls around dramatically*
        
        The spirits whisper a secret: Adults who play
        Stay young in their hearts forever.
        So go forth and be GLORIOUSLY silly!
        Dance in the snow! Stick out your tongue at the wind!
        Life is too short to be boring, especially in winter!"

      *Madame Zelda winks and does a little dance*
      "Wheee! Don't take life so seriously, little one!"
      *Glitter seems to fall from nowhere like magic snow*
