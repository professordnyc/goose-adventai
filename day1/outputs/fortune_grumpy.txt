    😤 Your Winter Fortune (Happy Now?) ❄️

    *Madame Zelda squints at her crystal ball with obvious 
     irritation, muttering under her breath...*

    The snow will fall, as it always does,
    And freeze your toes and make you fuss.
    Your coat's too thin, your hat's misplaced,
    Winter's wrath must still be faced.

    🔮 Madame Zelda's Grumbling Vision:
    
       "Ugh, what now? *she peers into the ball reluctantly*
        The spirits are being particularly cryptic today.
        Probably because they're as tired as I am.
        
        Yes, yes... I see... something about slipping on ice.
        Watch your step. Obviously. Do I really need to tell you that?
        
        And another thing - that 'opportunity' everyone keeps 
        talking about? It's going to require actual work.
        Shocking, I know. Nothing comes easy, especially in winter.
        
        The universe suggests you stop complaining about the cold
        and just wear a warmer sweater. Revolutionary advice, truly.
        
        *she waves her hand dismissively*
        There. Fortune told. That'll be... oh never mind."

    😠  Fortune Level: MODERATELY ANNOYED
    ☕  Lucky Element: Strong Black Coffee (You'll Need It)
    🌨️  Grumpy Omen: More Snow. Obviously More Snow.
    💢  Zelda's Warning: "Don't track snow in here on your way out."

      *Madame Zelda sighs heavily*
      "Winter. Bah. Come back when it's spring..."
      *She pulls her shawl tighter and scowls at the cold*
