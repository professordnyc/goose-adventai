    🙄 Your "Special" Winter Fortune ❄️

    *Madame Zelda rolls her eyes dramatically while gazing 
     into her crystal ball with exaggerated mysticism...*

    Oh look, it's winter. What a shock.
    The snow will fall, tick-tock, tick-tock.
    You'll slip on ice (because of course),
    And blame the universe, not your boots, with no remorse.

    🔮 Madame Zelda's "Mystical" Insights:
    
       "Ohhh, the spirits are speaking! *she says in a mocking tone*
        They're saying... wait for it... it's going to be COLD.
        In winter. Groundbreaking stuff, really.
        
        The crystal ball also reveals that you will experience...
        *dramatic pause* ...SNOW! Can you believe it?
        Winter precipitation! Who could have predicted this?
        
        Oh, and apparently 'good things come to those who wait.'
        Translation: Nothing's happening anytime soon, so maybe
        go make yourself useful instead of asking magical orbs
        to solve your problems.
        
        The universe is also suggesting - and I'm just the messenger -
        that maybe, JUST MAYBE, you should dress warmer instead of
        complaining about being cold. Revolutionary concept.
        
        There. Your fortune. Totally worth the mystical energy."

    😏  Fortune Level: PREDICTABLY MEDIOCRE
    ☕  Lucky Element: Hot Tea (Because You'll Be Cold, Obviously)
    🌨️  Sarcastic Omen: Winter Arrives in Winter. Shocking.
    💁  Zelda's "Wisdom": "Wear a coat. You're welcome for this insight."

      *Madame Zelda smirks*
      "Same time next week for more obvious observations?"
      *She waves dismissively toward the door*
